Devon is a full-stack web developer with over 7 years of experience, specializing in front-end development with a focus on Next.js in recent years. While his expertise also spans server administration, database management, and data migrations, he is passionate about crafting intuitive and engaging user interfaces.

Outside of work, he is a devoted husband and father of two. He values curiosity and lifelong learning, spending his free time tending to his garden, experimenting with modular synthesizers, and exploring new ways to grow and improve himself as a husband, father, and developer.
